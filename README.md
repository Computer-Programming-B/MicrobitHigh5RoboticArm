# Build a "High 5" Robotic Arm
In this project, you will be using the micro:bit and a servoÂ to move a robotic arm. The micro:bit light sensor will trigger the servo, so that when a shadow of a hand passes over the LED array, the arm rotates into a "high 5" position.

### Step 1: Connect the servo to the micro:bit
Our Robotic Arm project will use the following parts:
- micro:bit
- Servo
- Alligator cables to connect the micro:bit to the servo
- Robotic arm (popsicle stick with hand cutout and servo mount) 

Use the following circuit diagram to connect the servo to the micro:bit with the alligator cables.

### Step 2: Build the Robotic Arm
There may already be a popsicle stick arm in your kit. If not, you will need to make one. Ask your teacher for a print out of a hand and a glue gun. Cut out the hand and glue it to one end of the stick. Glue the servo mount from your kit to the **side** of the popsicle stick at the other end.

Attach the robotic arm to the servo by pressing it into place.
